# Dolphin-Swarm-Clustering-Algorithm
Implemented a new bio-inspired clustering algorithm via simulating dolphins’ swarm intelligence in their predation which brought out better performance than k-means++ in many test cases. Utilized dolphins’ characteristics including echolocation, labor assignment and information exchange to enable the algorithm to adjust the number of clusters automatically and to improve the algorithm’s efficiency
